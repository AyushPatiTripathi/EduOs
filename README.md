# 🧠 EduOS — Educational Operating System Simulator

EduOS is a visual & interactive simulator of how an Operating System works — built for learning core CS concepts like process scheduling, memory management, file systems, and command-line interfaces.

## 🚀 Features (to be built)
- ✅ Process Scheduler: FCFS, Round Robin, SJF
- ✅ Memory Simulator: Allocation strategies, paging
- ✅ File System: Create/delete folders/files
- ✅ Terminal: Run commands like `ls`, `mkdir`, `run`
- ✅ Visualization: Gantt chart, memory blocks

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- Python 3
- PyQt5 (UI)
- matplotlib (for graphs)
- Standard Python libraries (for logic)
